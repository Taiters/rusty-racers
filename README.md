I wanted to build a race car training app using the NEAT algorithm.. with no prior experience with genetic algorithms.

The [knapsack](./knapsack/) and [salesman](./salesman/) folders here are me playing about to learn some more about genetic algorithms, and [salesman-web](./salesman-web) is a web interface to play with the salesman genetic algorithm.
